Calculates wind pressures as per AS1170.2:2002

I think the standards are under copyright which is really wierd. Thus they are currently stored in a database. 

Project has being put on ICE waiting upond final approval then it will be linked up as a flask web app. In the meantime, math and table lookups are working as expected. 

This math is to a higher standard than that AS1170.2:2002 require as per office policy.
